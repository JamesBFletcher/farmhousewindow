            Many food workers around the world are being mistreated. They are paid below minimum wage and work in a poor condition. For instance, people working at restaurant sectors have to rely on customer’s tips which are being abused by the customers and even co-workers. This can lead to sexual harassments (according to online resources, “women who had previously worked as tipped workers were 1.6 times as likely to live with inappropriate behaviors in the workplace as women who were currently employed as tipped workers”). Moreover, women and migrant workers are likely to be cashiers/dishwashers, the lowest-paid occupation in the industry, than men or white people. These issues are all due to “bundles of powers” or also known as the “Goliaths”.

                Saru Jayaraman, in her chapter “Food Workers Taking On Goliath”, describes some strategies for fighting back: “Our hope is to join with other food system reform advocates to ultimately dismantle the undue influence of the NRA and all other major food corporations and trade lobbies.” We need to let others know the real story behind power corporations and make it a public understanding of an issue. Setting up direct events and campaigns will spread the word of economic instability, sexual harassment, and raicial discrimation that food workers are going through.
              </p> <br> <br>
              <ol>
                <p>These are some list of steps to fight off the Goliath:</p>
                <p>1. Join a union and collectively bargain</p>
                <p>2. “Right-to-work” laws: meaningful penalties against employers who interfere with workers who wish to form or join a union</p>
                <p>3. Provide a process to ensure that workers in a union can reach a contract</p>
                <p>4. Raise minimum wage and raise the overtime salary threshold to a meaningful level</p>
                <p>5. Boost enforcement of all current labor and employment standards</p>
              </ol> <br> <br>

              <p>
                In my view, I think we need everyone to fight against the ‘Goliath’, not only the food workers themselves. They need to support the food workers and start more campaigns to let others know what is really happening behind the scenes. I believe Jayaraman’s strategies of dismantling the undue influe of the NRA is a good idea. But I think we need more support from others in order to accomplish our strategy.

        <h4>Rape in the Fields</h4>
    <p>Produced By Andres Cediel</p><br>
        <p>
          LOWELL BERGMAN, Correspondent: [voice-over] There are over half million women working in the fields of America. Most are undocumented immigrants. This is a story about the price many women pay to keep those jobs, and to keep food on our tables.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st FARMWORKER: [subtitles] The foreman told my father “We have no work for you, but I can hire your daughters.” And from the moment we started to work in the fields, they harassed us horribly.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd FARMWORKER: [subtitles] They look at you like they own you, and whenever they want you, they can have you.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd FARMWORKER: [subtitles] I don’t speak English. I don’t have work papers. So I have to put up with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th FARMWORKER: [subtitles] He was in control because he was the supervisor. He was in charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th FARMWORKER: [subtitles] He would say, “One more time, one more time” over and over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th FARMWORKER: [subtitles] And if you don’t give in, you don’t have a job the next season.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th FARMWORKER: [subtitles] We were all afraid. They could hurt me or my family.

    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <h4>Sexual Assault And Farmworkers</h4>
    <p>Produced By Lulu Garcia-Navarro</p> <br>
        <p>
          Rosalinda Guillen: “Well, I think it's historic. I mean, as a - growing up in a farmworker family, I'm the oldest of eight, started working in the fields myself when I was 10 years old and have been organizing for over 31 years. And if you look at the history of the farmworker community and the farmworker labor force in agriculture, this has always been a problem. This is not new for us. And it's something that we've talked about for many years. There are many organizations that have tried to change the system. But unfortunately, in the agricultural industry, especially in the large agricultural corporate farms, if women complain or there's even an issue of women possibly filing a lawsuit or complaining about harassment, the retaliation that they get from that is usually losing their jobs. And farmworkers being one of the poorest workforce in the nation - that is just not acceptable, especially when that last paycheck means your rent, your grocery bill or clothes or needs that your children have.” 
        </p>
        <p>
          Guillen: “That is exactly true. There have been women that have endured sexual harassment for years because they do not want to complain, knowing that if they do, that same supervisor will take action or retaliate against the family. Even if they fire her, they take retaliation against the family. And they do not want to have their family lose their jobs. I mean, it's their livelihood.” 
        </p>
        <p>
          Guillen: “No privacy. In some cases, they actually look like slave cabins. I mean, they're small. They're wooden shacks. Many of them - in fact, I have not seen one. They do not have bathrooms in the living facility itself. If you don't have a bathroom in your home or in your living space, you have to walk, in some cases, quite a ways to get to the toilet, to get to a shower. And this creates another vulnerability for women and something that they always have to be careful of, especially young girls.”

    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <h4>Sexual-Harassment Epidemic</h4>
    <p>Produced By Ariel Ramchandani</p> <br>
        <p>
          She “saw pretty quickly this was a different situation.” When she didn’t receive her full pay the first week, she went to the crew leader, Reyes Tapia-Ortiz, who told her he couldn’t do anything about it. “This is what I’m paying you. There’s no way to negotiate it differently,”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Perez told me that when she asked the owner about the pay situation, they said she had to figure it out with Tapia-Ortiz, who was a contractor hired to recruit laborers, and when she brought it up with him again he became angry. He told her she had no rights and no papers, so she shouldn’t complain.”        </p>
        <p>
          Perez kept pushing for what she believed she was owed. As the situation escalated, Tapia-Ortiz sexually harassed Perez, according to the lawsuit. In 2011,  she says, he promised to pay her more if she had sex with him, grabbed her from behind, and fondled her breasts. In August, according to the lawsuit, she says when she rejected his advances and threatened to call the police, he threatened to get her deported. In the fall of 2011, according to the lawsuit, he made sexual advances while she was working in a secluded area among tall tomato plants. After she rejected him, he showed her his pistol in his waistband, she says. He would often wave a rifle or show the pistol to the workers to threaten them, according to the complaint. “Truly I did feel very intimidated and very fearful. I just arrived and I didn’t know anything about the laws or who to call or what I could say or how to say it,” Perez said to me.

            “When the man who feeds the world by toiling in the fields is himself deprived of the basic rights of feeding, sheltering and caring for his own family, the whole community of man is sick.” -  Cesar Chavez

          <p>
            “We can choose to use our lives for others to bring about a better and more just world for our children. People who make that choice will know hardship and sacrifice. But if you give yourself totally to the non-violence struggle for peace and justice you also find that people give you their hearts and you will never go hungry and never be alone. And in giving of yourself you will discover a whole new life full of meaning and love.” - Cesar Chavez

            “It is clearly evident that our path travels through a valley of tears well known to all farm workers, because in all valleys the way of the farm workers has been one of sacrifice for generations. Our sweat and our blood have fallen on this land to make other men rich. This pilgrimage is a witness to the suffering we have seen for generations.” - Cesar Chavez
