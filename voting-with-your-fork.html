            It is absurd to preach that all Americans have the capability and are responsible for shaping a morally just and nutritious food system.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: left;">
            While it is true that consumer demand does increase the supply of products, it is unrealistic to assume that people have the means or knowledge to make the best choices, particularly when they are being influenced by million dollar companies.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: left;"s>
            The poorest 40% of Americans spend roughly 20-35% of their income on food, therefore even if healthier alternatives were available even a 10% increase in food costs is not a feasible option, especially when you consider that even before COVID-19 40% of American adults could not cover a $400 emergency.         </p>

                Additionally, large corporations profit off of performative actions in which they deceive consumers into believing that they have made large changes to their company. Many customers do not investigate further if the changes companies make cause any legitimate difference thus allowing corporations to make minimal change while gaining credibility amongst consumers . An example of this is when McDonalds changed to paper bag packaging in an attempt to show their customers they are a more environmentally conscious company, whilst not making any effort to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions their food products create. Consumers feel less guilty because they believe that McDonalds has listened to their complaints and changed to encompass environmentally conscious values and would feel comfortable “voting with their forks” at this corporation.

                    Larger corporations also manufacture products that consumers believe to be better alternatives, thus you cannot completely “vote with your fork” if you are still voting for the same company. A large majority of consumers do not have time to dedicate towards researching the ethics and ownership of brands they are purchasing from, meaning many rely on packaging when making purchasing decisions. This can be deceiving as many consumers do not understand that even labels such as “sustainable” do not have any legal definition which allows companies to manipulate consumers into believing that their products are more environmentally friendly. If anything, the “vote with your fork” movement has led to companies profiting off of upper-middle class Americans who are willing to purchase more expensive products with minimal improvements.

                <p style = "text-align: left;">
                    The largest issue with preaching for consumers to “vote with their forks” is the feasibility of it. For starters, it would take a large amount of consumers boycotting products for companies to notice and be forced to make actual change. This is unrealistic as many people are unable to do so due to a lack of money, time, and access to ingredients. It also has the potential of leading to a phenomenon in which people support small businesses and farmers who then must scale up to meet demand and

                    A more efficient way to spend those extra dollars is by donating to nonprofit organizations working to combat injustices in the food system. An excellent example of this is the Coalition of Immokalee Workers who organized farm workers and student groups to stage boycotts and various demonstrations to combat mistreatments of agricultural workers. Donating to a coalition, such as this, is more effective and efficient as it ensures your money is being used to provide justice to the food system and is handled by people committed to and knowledgeable on the topic.

                <p style = "text-align: left;">
                    It is critical to remember that the morality of our food system does not rest upon citizens. If companies wanted to have an ethical food system they have the power to do so, they could cut marketing budgets and reduce CEO’s salaries, but they choose not to. So yes, it is important to support local farmers and be educated about what you are putting into your body and stand up for the mistreatment of workers, but it also important to remember that this guilt should be placed upon corporations not citizens. The most impactful action you can take is to vote with your ballot, not your fork, for politicians who will represent your values and make an effort to improve our food system to be equitable and just for all.
